Where Music Inspires. 
***
# Project Conception

The overall concept of Apollo centered around bringing music lovers and music collaborators together in one space to share, inspire, and educate one another on their passion for music. 

### Motivation

The motivation to create this application became apparent as we started researching concepts. There are a lack of collaborative, social spaces online dedicated to music. We felt empowered to begin developing a page that would allow for this type of collaboration to exist. 

### UI/UX

In Greek Mythology, Apollo was the God of the Sun, the Light, the Music, and Prophecy. We felt inclined to incorporate these elements as we styled the page. 

Our goal was to create simplicity on each page.  Create an easy to use interface that was produced calming affects for our users to create, educate, and learn in a stress â€“free environment.
